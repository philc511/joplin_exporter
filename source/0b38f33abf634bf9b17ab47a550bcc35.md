trustee meeting with Dan

1) should we change our trust into a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) which gives greater protection for trustees? Nigel says we should get advice and probably do this

2) Information ahead of meetings. He suggested it was much better to send finance updates before the meetings to allow proper scrutiny

3) Finance update for church. I'd like to get your input into a report for church distribution showing 2012 income and expenditure and current challenges (currently income Â£2k per month behind budget)

Trustee meeting dates - 6/8 per year, dates in diaries
