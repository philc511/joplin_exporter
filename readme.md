This is a script to help me export notes out of Joplin and into Simplenote

Use the JEX format exprorted from Joplin, and need to get the notes into this JSON file:

{
  "activeNotes": [
    {
      "id": "20a78f1a-113e-46bb-ad42-af726ecf93d1",
      "content": "# title\r\n**bold**\r\n\r\n",
      "creationDate": "2021-07-04T17:11:51.428Z",
      "lastModified": "2021-07-04T17:13:52.537Z",
      "markdown": true
    }
  ],
  "trashedNotes": [
  ]
}
